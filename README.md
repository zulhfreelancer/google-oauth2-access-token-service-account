Snippets to get Google OAuth 2 Access Token for Firebase Service Account. Scripts available in Node and Ruby language (see the folders).

To create the private key (JSON), refer to Firebase official documentation [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/rest/auth#google_oauth2_access_tokens).

FYI, Google has a public API endpoint to check the access token expiry. It's available here (GET):
`https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/tokeninfo?access_token=YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN`
